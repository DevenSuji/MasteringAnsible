# This playbook uses force_handlers: True. Usually a playbook will stop is a task fails to run. Here we are deliberately making the task to fail by trying to copy
# a file that does not exist. Ideally the play should stop when the task fails to run, but since we've used force_handlers: True, the handler will still be executed
# even when the task fails
