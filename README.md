# MasteringAnsible
Hey There....

ENOUGH IS ENOUGH...

It's become personal now.
I'm mostly a PowerShell guy, but I work with people who have good knowledge on Ansible.
These people are the most selfish people I've ever met.
Extermely poor collaboration skills.
No intent to help someone who is just a begginner in Ansible.
Enough is Enough.....
It's personal now.....
I'm gonna master Ansible no matter what!!!!!!
