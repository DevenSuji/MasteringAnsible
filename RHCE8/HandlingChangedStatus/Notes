1. Managing the changed status may be important as handlers triggers as per the changed status.
2. The result of the command can be registered, and the registered variable can be scanned for specific text to determine that a change has occured.
3. This allows ansible to report a changed stauts, where it normally would not, thus allowing handlers to be triggered.
4. Using changed_when is helpful in two cases:
	--->>> To allow handlers to run when a change is not reported by a task.
	--->>> To To disable commands that run successful to report a changed status.
