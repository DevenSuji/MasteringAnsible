Ansible looks at the exit status of a task to determine whether is was successfull or failure.
When any taks fails, Ansible aborts the rest of the play on that host and continues with the other hosts.
Different solutions can be used to change this behaviour because it is not always the desired behaviour.
### Solutions
    1. Use ignore_errors in a task to ignore failures.
    2. Use force_handlers to force a handler that has been triggered to run, even if another task fails.

Defining Failure States
1. As Ansible only looks at the exit status of the failed tasks, it may think that a task was successfull, but that need not be the case always.
2. To be more specific and to contain this behaviour use failed_when condition to specify what to look for in a command output to recognise a failure.

FAILED_WHEN

1. The failed_when keyword can be used ina task to identify when a task has failed.
2. The fail module can be used to print a message that informs why a task has failed.
3. To use failed_when and fail, the result of the command must be registered, and the registered variable output must be analyzed.
4. When using fail module, the failing task must have ignore_errors set to yes.
