Dictionaries
------------

=> Dictionaries can be written in below mentioned two ways:

Users:
  linda:
    username: linda
    shell: /bin/bash
  lisa:
    username: lisa
    shell: /bin/tsh

OR

Users:
  linda:{ username: 'linda', shell: 'bin/bash' }
  lisa:{ username: 'lisa', shell: 'bin/tsh' }

*** To address items in a dictionary, you can use two notations:
    =>  variable_name['key'], as in Users['linda']['shell']
    OR
    =>  variable_name.key, as in Users.linda.shell

*** you cannot use loop or with_items on dictionaries
